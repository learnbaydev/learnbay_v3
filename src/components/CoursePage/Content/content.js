              <p>
                Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that makes use of
                various disciplines to extract insights from data. Currently,
                companies hold enormous amounts of data that contain some
                valuable information.
              </p>
              <p>
                It has to be identified, collected, and analyzed to make the
                most out of it. Data Science plays a vital role in such
                situations, it helps to manage, clean, and explore the data.
                Also, it builds models using the gathered information to predict
                outcomes and automate important tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data Scientists, the practitioners of Data Science, will explain
                the findings and solutions through data storytelling to make
                everyone understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Simply put, Data Scientists collect, clean, analyze, and explain
                the data through storytelling. At present, almost every company
                requires the help of the data science profession. Enroll in an

                Artificial Intelligence is like cognitive ability injected in a
                machine to mimic a human and act like a human. Artificial
                intelligence helps make decisions; recognize speech, images, and
                words; and analyze large amounts of information.
              </p>
              <p>
                At present, most companies and individuals use Artificial

              <p>
                Business Analytics is a process that combines applications of
                statistical and quantitative techniques to analyze the data to
                extract meaningful insights. The extracted information or data
                will be used by decision-makers to come up with business
                decisions, and strategies for optimizing the business
                operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                At present, Business Analytics seems to be the most accepted
                best practice adopted by every MNC worldwide. Business Analytics
                has changed how the industries view manufacturing, retail
                operations, and making decisions. Business Analytics has helped
                companies make informed decisions, these decisions are fueled by

                and develop strategies to enhance productivity.

                      Data scientists in general have broader roles and duties
                      to play. On the contrary, BFSI data scientists are liable
                      to handle finance-related tasks. In today’s changing job
                      landscape, having domain-led expertise is vital for
                      experts. Becoming a data scientist in the BFSI domain can
                      be fruitful in the long run with a specialized career
                      path. Data science in financial services deals with –

                        From a career perspective, data scientists in the BFSI
                        domain can lead specific roles across global financial
                        organizations. A general data scientist can earn INR 8
                        LPA – INR 23 LPA on average. On the other hand, the
                        average salary for a data scientist in financial
